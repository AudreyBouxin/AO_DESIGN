\section{Scope of this document}

This document presents the DAG adaptive optics (AO) optical train design and optimization.

\section{Introduction}
There are several mandatory points we have to handle :
\begin{itemize}
	\item the exit pupil has to be imaged on the DM;
	\item the DM diameter is fixed to the DM-468 from ALPAO; that means \diameter $33$ mm;
	\item the exits pupil has to be imaged on the TT mirror for the P-WFS modulation;
	\item the beam has to converge on the pyramid apex;
	\item the angle of the beam that arrives onto the pyramid apex is calculated in order to get a diffraction limited PSF size of 2 times the pyramid roof;
	\item the exit pupil has to be imaged onto the EMCCD detector
	\item the beam footprint diameter onto the detector has to be defined accordingly to the oversampling criterion (explained section~\ref{subsec:4eme_partie}).
\end{itemize}

We use off axis parabolas (OAPs) for all our design to reduce the aberrations (compared to lenses).
We have added one more constraint on the design which is to have parallel beam arriving or leaving each off axis parabola in order to limit the spherical aberrations.\\

The fixed parameters are resumed here :
\begin{itemize}
	\item exit pupil diameter : \diameter$_{\text{ExtP}} = 727.4046$ mm;
	\item distance exit pupil to focal plane : $\overline{\text{ExP-FP}} = 10338.74$ mm; 
	\item DM diameter : \diameter$_{\text{DM}} = 33.0$ mm;
	\item pixel size of the Nuvuu EMCCD AO : $\text{PxSize} = 24$ $\mu$m
\end{itemize}
\newpage
In order to design the AO bench we started with the telescope model. Indeed, we would try to compensate for the field of curvature introduced by the mirrors of the telescope with the off-axis parabolas (OAP) of the AO. The Zemax model of the telescope shows a curvature radius of about 1255 mm.

\section{Design development and optimization}
A preliminary design have been set for the PDR and the main points are summarized at each optimization step of this report.

\subsection{Imaging the exit pupil of the telescope onto the DM}
The first branch consists on an imaging system of the telescope pupil onto the DM. The beam has to be collimated and the footprint has to take the entire clear aperture of the DM (for the DM-468 from ALPAO $\diameter_{\text{DM}}$~=~33~mm).\\
The beam on the DM has to be reflected with a certain angle otherwise the reflected beam comes back on itself. The maximum acceptable angle can be calculated considering the position error of the beam per actuator on the DM. We can align the beam with an error of $1/10^{th} \Lambda$ ($\Lambda$ the actuator pitch $= 1.5$ mm for the ALPAO DM-468). In order for the projected beam diameter to be no more than 10\% smaller than the DM diameter on both side, the tilt of the DM must be no more than $\alpha$~(figure \ref{fig:OAP0_DM_diam_beam_diam})~:
\begin{eqnarray}
	\alpha &= &\arccos\left(1-\frac{1}{5}\frac{\Lambda}{\diameter_{\text{DM}}}\right)\nonumber\\
	\alpha &= &\arccos\left(1-\frac{1}{5}\frac{1.5}{33}\right)\nonumber\\
	\alpha &= &7.73^{ \circ}\label{eq:alphaDM}\\
	2\alpha &= &15.46^{ \circ}\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{images/OAP0_DM_diam_beam_diam.PNG}
		\caption{Sketch of the input and output beam depending on the tilt angle of the DM}\label{fig:OAP0_DM_diam_beam_diam}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
The input beam diameter is then :
\begin{equation}
	\diameter_{\text{DM-beam}} = \diameter_{\text{DM}} \cos{\alpha} = 33\times \cos{(7.73)} = 32.7 \text{ mm}
\end{equation}

In order to have a collimated beam on the DM with a diameter of $\diameter_{\text{DM-beam}}$, the focal length of the OAP0 is calculated by the following sequence of equations. To visualize the parameters needed and the context we can look at figure~\ref{fig:sketch_ray_tracing_OAP0}. The with an angle $\theta$ with the corresponding reference coordinates $\left(0,x',y'\right)$. The ray $\Delta$CR corresponds to the chief ray, $\Delta\alpha u$ is the "upper" marginal ray and $\Delta\alpha b$ is the "bottom" marginal ray. The origin is placed at the focal plane of the telescope.

\begin{figure}[H]

		\caption{Ray tracing of a tilted parabola}\label{fig:sketch_ray_tracing_OAP0}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
In the reference coordinates $\left(0,x',y'\right)$, we have (with PFL the Parental Focal Length of the OAP):
\begin{itemize}
	\item equation of the parabola $\theta$ : 
	\begin{equation}
	y' = \frac{x'^2}{4\,\text{PFL}}-\text{PFL}	\label{eq:parabola_theta}
	\end{equation}
	\item equation of $\Delta\alpha u$ : \begin{equation}
	y' = -\frac{1}{\tan\left(\theta+\alpha\right)}x' \label{eq:delta_alphau}
	\end{equation}
	\item equation of $\Delta\alpha b$ : \begin{equation}
	y' = -\frac{1}{\tan\left(\theta-\alpha\right)}x' \label{eq:delta_alphab}
	\end{equation}
\end{itemize}
%
%Determination of $x'_{\text{CR}\theta}$ (intersection between parabola $\theta$ and $\Delta$CR) :\\ \eqref{eq:parabola_theta} = \eqref{eq:delta_CR}\\
%\begin{equation}
%	x'_{\text{CR}\theta} = 2\,\text{PFL}\left(-\frac{1}{\tan\theta}+\sqrt{\frac{1}{\tan^2\theta}+1}\right)
%\end{equation}

Determination of $x'_{\text{Ex}\theta\,\,u}$ (intersection between parabola $\theta$ and $\Delta\alpha u$) :\\ \eqref{eq:parabola_theta} = \eqref{eq:delta_alphau}\\
\begin{equation}
	x'_{\text{Ex}\theta\,\,u} = 2\,\text{PFL}\left(-\frac{1}{\tan\left(\theta+\alpha\right)}+\sqrt{\frac{1}{\tan^2\left(\theta+\alpha\right)}+1}\right)
\end{equation}

Determination of $x'_{\text{Ex}\theta\,\,b}$ (intersection between parabola $\theta$ and $\Delta\alpha b$) :\\ \eqref{eq:parabola_theta} = \eqref{eq:delta_alphab}\\
\begin{equation}
	x'_{\text{Ex}\theta\,\,b} = 2\,\text{PFL}\left(-\frac{1}{\tan\left(\theta-\alpha\right)}+\sqrt{\frac{1}{\tan^2\left(\theta-\alpha\right)}+1}\right)
\end{equation}

In order to have the OAP0 output beam diameter equal to the DM clear aperture we have~:
\begin{equation}
	x'_{\text{Ex}\theta\,\,u}-x'_{\text{Ex}\theta\,\,b} = \diameter_\text{DM-beam}
\end{equation}
The parental focal length (see appendix~\ref{sec:EFL2PFL}) of OAP0 is :
\begin{equation}
	\text{PFL} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{\diameter_\text{DM-beam}}{-\frac{1}{\tan\left(\theta+\alpha\right)}+\sqrt{\frac{1}{\tan^2\left(\theta+\alpha\right)}+1}+\frac{1}{\tan\left(\theta-\alpha\right)}-\sqrt{\frac{1}{\tan^2\left(\theta-\alpha\right)}+1}}
\end{equation}
Using the equation~\eqref{eq:EFL2PFL} described in appendix~\ref{sec:EFL2PFL} we can transform the parental focal length into the effective focal length.\\

For the OAP0 the angle $\alpha_{\text{OAP0}}$ is
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:alpha_OAP0}
	\alpha_{\text{OAP0}} &= &\arctan\left(\frac{\diameter_{\text{ExP}/2}}{\overline{\text{ExP-FP}}}\right)
\end{eqnarray} 
The numerical application of \eqref{eq:alpha_OAP0} with $\diameter_{\text{ExP}} = 727.4046$ mm and $\overline{\text{ExP-FP}} = 10338.74$ mm gives $\alpha_{\text{OAP0}}  = 2.015\degree$, the aperture demi~angle of the beam arriving on the first OAP.\\

After the discussion we had with Paolo Spano, we took his advice into account and choose the parabola tilt angle according to the following precept : $\theta= 35\degree$ is a critical choice and $\theta > 35\degree$ is a nightmare (manufacturing and alignment). We should take an tilt angle smaller than 30$\degree$ to be realistic and the smaller the best. However, we are limited by the space around the focal plane because of the field correction lens (represented by the bloc on figure~\ref{fig:FCL_space_OAP0}). Depending on where it is going to be placed we would have to increase the angle of OAP0. \textbf{An email has been sent to AMOS who is going to design the FCL to know if it is possible to have it before the focal plane.}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{images/FCL_space_OAP0.PNG}
		\caption{Field correction lens position from the focal plane of the telescope}\label{fig:FCL_space_OAP0}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

We  can set the parabola tilt angle to $\theta = 20\degree$ in order to keep this angle as small as possible to limit aberrations.\\

Using these inputs the focal length of the OAP0 is (appendix~\ref{app:DimensionnementOAPs}): $\text{PFL}_{\text{OAP0}} = 443.13\,\text{mm}	\nonumber$.\\
This value is too specific so we round it to\footnote{In Zemax, we enter the $\text{PFL}_{\text{OAP0}}$ and not the effective focal length in the coordinate break surface because using it, the translation is done before the tilt angle. This is why if we enter the translation in a surface before the coordinate break we cannot use the same length (we would then write the $\text{EFL}_{\text{OAP0}}$)}~:
\begin{equation}
	\text{PFL}_{\text{OAP0}} = 445\,\text{mm}	\nonumber
\end{equation}

\newpage
The image of the exit pupil given by OAP0 gives the position of the DM. Its position $p_i$ relative to the OAP0 vertex is given by (we use Gauss law)~:
\begin{eqnarray}
	p_i &= &\frac{p_o\,\text{PFL}_{\text{OAP0}}}{p_o+\text{PFL}_{\text{OAP0}}}\\
	p_i &= &\frac{-(10338.74+445)445}{-10338.74}\\
	p_i &= &464\,\text{mm}
\end{eqnarray}
The Zemax "pick up pupil position" macro is used to get the perfect DM position wrt the OAP0. The DM is then at $p_i = 493.08$ mm. Even if we understand that we cannot align the DM reflecting surface with this accuracy, we keep it in the Zemax model  and we will work on that during the tolerancing analysis\footnote{We always keep all the digit during an AO design in order to see what are the best results we can obtain with an ideal system.}. \\
The image of the pupil through a tilted OAP is also tilted~(see~\cite{cite:Design90degOAP}). This creates pupil aberrations.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{images/DM_pupil_tilt.PNG}
		\caption{Tilted image of the pupil}\label{fig:DM_pupil_tilt}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
Here we want to place the DM at this pupil position. When we work with OAPs the image stop after an OAP is not perpendicular to the optical axis. The OAP introduce a tilt angle of the image plane. If we tilt the DM in the opposite position of this OAP-introduced tilt angle we add pupil aberrations whereas if we tilt it the same direction we can compensate for it.

\end{figure}

The beam footprint on the DM shows that all the field fits inside the clear aperture. The maximum diameter is equal to 32.7306 mm ($< 33$ mm). The angle of the DM is set to~-7.73\degree~(equation~\eqref{eq:alphaDM}),and not 7.73\degree as explain above.

\subsection{Imaging the pupil on the TT modulation mirror}

\subsubsection{Create an image of the pupil}
We need to image the pupil on the TT modulation mirror. Moreover, we know that to compensate for the introduced aberration from OAP0 we can use an OAP1 with the same focal length. The F/D ratio would stay the same as the telescope one which is favourable for the science path.\\
Figure~\ref{fig:Zemax_model_FP_OAP1} shows that to model this combination we use the "chief ray" solve on Zemax (Lens data) to keep the coordinates following the beam path (using the on-axis ray). OAP1 is placed at the exact inverse position of OAP0 in order to compensate for its aberrations so the intermediate focal plane is near the telescope focal plane.\\

\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/Zemax_model_FP_OAP1.PNG}
		\caption{Zemax model from the telescope beam to the intermediate focal plane}\label{fig:Zemax_model_FP_OAP1}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
We use an optimization (smallest spot radius) to go to the best focal plane (surface \# 76 thickness is set as variable) and in order to consider the field curvature we set the radius of the image plane variable. The optimization using a merit function (Type~:~P2V, Criteria~:~Spot~Radius, Reference~:~Chief~Ray) is done on the image surface to get the smallest spot radius of the central beam (FoV = 0'). We can see that the spot diameter varies between 0.511~$\mu$m and 0.009~$\mu$m (the center of the FoV) but when we look the spots with the Airy disk we can say that the beam is well focused.\\
However, the radius of the image curvature is smaller than the telescope output field of curvature so we did not compensate for that, instead we increase it (we will see how we could work on that or not).\\

\subsubsection{Bend the beam}
We do not want the beam to go back in the field correction lens and we would like to place the dichroic nearby the intermediate focal plane. In order to do that properly, we fold the beam after the DM with a flat mirror.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/FP_2_intFP_FoldMirror.PNG}
		\caption{Zemax model from the telescope beam to the intermediate focal plane with a fold mirror after the DM}\label{fig:FP_2_intFP_FoldMirror}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:FP_2_intFP_FoldMirror} shows the new design with a folding mirror tilted at 20\degree. For more clarity we apply the real aperture size of the OAPs on layout 1. We can see on the footprint diagram that we can use two OAPs of 2~inches of diameter. The maximum diameter of the beam footprint (for a FoV~=~1') is about 49.9~mm. However, we should be careful and verify during the tolerance analysis that when we move the OAP in the alignment precision range we can do, the entire beam stays reflected on the OAP (no vignetting). Concerning the folding mirror, we can also use a diameter of 2~inches it is positioned at 298~mm from the DM (same as above, we have to check during the tolerancing that we do not have vignetting when moving around this position).\\

After redoing the optimization of the intermediate focal plane position and the image radius of curvature we found spot diameters vary from 0.009~$\mu$m (on-axis) to 0.603~$\mu$m (0.5') across the FoV (see figure~\ref{fig:IntermediateFP_SpotDiagram}).\\
\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{images/IntermediateFP_SpotDiagram.PNG}
		\caption{Spot diagram at the intermediate focal plane for the AO FoV and the WFS path FoV}\label{fig:IntermediateFP_SpotDiagram}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Imaging the pupil on the TT modulation mirror}
\hl{The selection of the star in the FoV is made using an XY stage where all the WFS path would be mounted (as we have a compact WFS path).}
Now, as the OAP0 and OAP1 are the same, this optical configuration creates an image of the pupil of the same diameter at the same distance from the FP as the entrance pupil.\\ 
It is so not possible to use it to place the TT modulation mirror which has to be about 10~mm in diameter and at a reasonable distance from FP.
\hl{FOR these reasons........................................ we take a TT modulation mirror of \diameter 0.5~inch mounted on the fast tip-tilt platform S-331 from PI.}
We want to have a beam of about 10~mm in diameter at the pupil to place the TT stage.\\

We have also to note that we would like to introduce a dichroic membrane nearby the intermediate focal plane.

We know that we need to arrive on the pyramid roof (P-WFS) with a corresponding~:
\begin{equation}
	 F\#=2\frac{\text{pyramid roof}}{\lambda}\label{eq:FnumEq}
\end{equation}
Taking a pyramid roof of about $20~\mu$m according to Jean-Pierre Veran (private communication) at $\lambda~=~0.6~\mu$m we have~:
\begin{equation}
	F\# = 66.7\label{eq:Fnum}
\end{equation}
We round this value to F\#~=~60 (we need to investigate the pyramid roof size that can be manufactured).\\

We want then an vergence that takes the beam with a F# of 14 and brings it to 60. The TT modulation mirror is placed in this converging beam at the pupil position


\subsection{Image the pupil on the CCD detector}\label{subsec:4eme_partie}
The detector is the Nuvuu EMCCD with 128~pixels and a pixel size of $24~\mu$~m. We have to sample the beam with at least 1 pixel per actuator. In order to relax the alignment problems we can oversample the beam. According to Jean-Pierre Veran advice an oversampling of 1.5 should be enough. The ALAPO DM-468 has 22 actuators across the clear aperture diameter (so 23 pitches). Then we can calculate the beam diameter on the detector :
\begin{eqnarray}
	\diameter_{\text{CCD}} &= &\#_{\text{actuator across \diameter}}\times \text{PxSize}\times\text{Oversampling factor}\\
	\diameter_{\text{CCD}} &= &22\times 24~\mu\text{m}\times 1.5\\
	\diameter_{\text{CCD}} &= &0.792\,\,\text{mm}
\end{eqnarray}
The pupil has to be images on the camera. The TT mirror (pupil plane) image through the OAP3 is at the infinity. So when we image it through the relay lens the pupil plane arrives at the focal plane of the relay lens. Moreover, in order to get the beam size on the camera, the focal length of the relay lens ($f_{\text{LR}}$, see appendix~\ref{sec:PYR2CCD}) has to be~:
\begin{eqnarray}
	f_{\text{LR}} &= &\text{F}\# \times \diameter_{\text{CCD}}\\
	f_{\text{LR}} &= &60\times 0.792\\
	f_{\text{LR}} &= &47.52\,\,\text{mm}
\end{eqnarray}
The remaining optics have been implemented in the Zemax model just to have an estimation of the space no optimization has been done (we can already see that the diameter is not precisely of $\diameter_\text{CCD}$).\\

		\caption{Zemax model of the bench until the CCD camera}\label{fig:Zemax_model_FP_CCD}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Atmopsheric Dispersion Compensator (ADC)}
We are designing an ADC to compensate the atmospheric dispersion (see appendix\ref{app:ADC}). The geometric parameters and the glass are not set yet this is why we do not have implemented it in the Zemax model for now. However, we can already say that the ADC would probably be inserted between OAP2 and OAP3 because the beam is collimated.
