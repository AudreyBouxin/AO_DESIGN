\section{Scope of this document}

This document presents the DAG adaptive optics (AO) optical train design and optimization.

\section{Introduction}
There are several mandatory points we have to handle :
\begin{itemize}
	\item the exit pupil has to be imaged on the DM (Deformable Mirror);
	\item the DM diameter is fixed to the DM-468 clear aperture from ALPAO; that means \O $33$ mm;
	\item the exit pupil of the telescope has to be imaged on the TT (Tip-Tilt) mirror for the P-WFS modulation;
	\item the beam has to converge on the pyramid apex;
	\item the angle of the beam that arrives onto the pyramid apex is calculated in order to get a diffraction limited PSF size of 2 times the pyramid roof;
	\item the exit pupil has to be imaged onto the Nuvu EMCCD detector;
	\item the beam footprint diameter onto the detector has to be defined accordingly to the oversampling criterion (explained section~\ref{subsec:Pup2CCD}).\\
\end{itemize}

We use off axis parabolas (OAPs) for all our design to reduce the aberrations (compared to lenses).
We have added one more constraint on the design which is to have parallel beam arriving or leaving each off axis parabola in order to limit the spherical aberrations.\\

The fixed parameters are resumed here :
\begin{itemize}
	\item exit pupil diameter : \diameter$_{\text{ExtP}} = 727.4046$ mm;
	\item distance from the exit pupil to the focal plane : $\overline{\text{ExP-FP}} = 10338.74$ mm; 
	\item DM diameter : \diameter$_{\text{DM}} = 33.0$ mm;
	\item pixel size of the Nuvuu EMCCD AO : $\text{PxSize} = 24$ $\mu$m
\end{itemize}
\newpage
In order to design the AO bench we started with the telescope model. Indeed, we would try to compensate for the field of curvature introduced by the mirrors of the telescope with the off-axis parabolas (OAP) of the AO. The Zemax model of the telescope shows a curvature radius of about 1255 mm.
\begin{figure}[H]

		\caption{Zemax model of the telescope}\label{fig:Zemax_model_telescope}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

Concerning off-axis aberrations for a future GLAO mode, they are totally dominated by the atmospheric aberrations through this telescope (30~nm for 2' FoV), so we do not need a field correction lens. In a first approach, we thought we should have one nearby the focal plane but this is not the case anymore.

\newpage
\section{Design development and optimization}
A preliminary design have been set for the PDR and the main points are summarized at each optimization step of this report.

\subsection{Imaging the exit pupil of the telescope onto the DM}
The first section consists on an imaging system of the telescope exit pupil onto the DM. The beam has to be collimated and the footprint has to take the entire clear aperture of the DM (for the DM-468 from ALPAO $\diameter_{\text{DM}}$~=~33~mm).\\
The beam on the DM has to be reflected with a certain angle otherwise the reflected beam comes back on itself. The maximum acceptable angle can be calculated considering the position error of the beam per actuator on the DM. We can align the beam with a registration error due to this elliptical beam footprint of $1/10^{th} \Lambda$ ($\Lambda$ the actuator pitch $= 1.5$ mm for the ALPAO DM-468). In order for the projected beam diameter to be no more than 10\% smaller than the DM diameter on both side, the tilt of the DM must be no more than $\alpha$~(figure \ref{fig:OAP0_DM_diam_beam_diam})~:


\noindent\begin{minipage}{.45\textwidth}
\begin{eqnarray}
	\alpha &= &\arccos\left(1-\frac{1}{5}\frac{\Lambda}{\diameter_{\text{DM}}}\right)\nonumber\\
	\alpha &= &\arccos\left(1-\frac{1}{5}\frac{1.5}{33}\right)\nonumber\\
	\alpha &= &7.73^{ \circ}\label{eq:alphaDM}\\
	2\alpha &= &15.46^{ \circ}\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{.45\textwidth}
   \centering
   \begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{images/OAP0_DM_diam_beam_diam.PNG}
		\caption{Sketch of the input and output beam depending on the tilt angle of the DM}\label{fig:OAP0_DM_diam_beam_diam}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
\end{minipage}

The input beam diameter is then :
\begin{equation}
	\diameter_{\text{DM-beam}} = \diameter_{\text{DM}} \cos{\alpha} = 33\times \cos{(7.73)} = 32.7 \text{ mm}
\end{equation}

In order to have a collimated beam on the DM with a diameter of $\diameter_{\text{DM-beam}}$, the focal length of the OAP0 is calculated by the following sequence of equations. To visualize the parameters needed and the context we can look at figure~\ref{fig:sketch_ray_tracing_OAP0}. The OAP is tilted with an angle $\theta$ and its corresponding reference coordinates is $\left(0,x',y'\right)$. The ray $\Delta$CR corresponds to the chief ray, $\Delta\alpha u$ is the "upper" marginal ray and $\Delta\alpha b$ is the "bottom" marginal ray. The origin is placed at the focal plane of the telescope.

\begin{figure}[H]

		\caption{Ray tracing of a tilted parabola}\label{fig:sketch_ray_tracing_OAP0}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
In the reference coordinates $\left(0,x',y'\right)$, we have (with PFL the Parental Focal Length of the OAP):
\begin{itemize}
	\item equation of the parabola $\theta$ : 
	\begin{equation}
	y' = \frac{x'^2}{4\,\text{PFL}}-\text{PFL}	\label{eq:parabola_theta}
	\end{equation}
	\item equation of $\Delta\alpha u$ : \begin{equation}
	y' = -\frac{1}{\tan\left(\theta+\alpha\right)}x' \label{eq:delta_alphau}
	\end{equation}
	\item equation of $\Delta\alpha b$ : \begin{equation}
	y' = -\frac{1}{\tan\left(\theta-\alpha\right)}x' \label{eq:delta_alphab}
	\end{equation}
\end{itemize}
%
%Determination of $x'_{\text{CR}\theta}$ (intersection between parabola $\theta$ and $\Delta$CR) :\\ \eqref{eq:parabola_theta} = \eqref{eq:delta_CR}\\
%\begin{equation}
%	x'_{\text{CR}\theta} = 2\,\text{PFL}\left(-\frac{1}{\tan\theta}+\sqrt{\frac{1}{\tan^2\theta}+1}\right)
%\end{equation}

Determination of $x'_{\text{Ex}\theta\,\,u}$ (intersection between parabola $\theta$ and $\Delta\alpha u$) :\\ \eqref{eq:parabola_theta} = \eqref{eq:delta_alphau}\\
\begin{equation}
	x'_{\text{Ex}\theta\,\,u} = 2\,\text{PFL}\left(-\frac{1}{\tan\left(\theta+\alpha\right)}+\sqrt{\frac{1}{\tan^2\left(\theta+\alpha\right)}+1}\right)
\end{equation}

Determination of $x'_{\text{Ex}\theta\,\,b}$ (intersection between parabola $\theta$ and $\Delta\alpha b$) :\\ \eqref{eq:parabola_theta} = \eqref{eq:delta_alphab}\\
\begin{equation}
	x'_{\text{Ex}\theta\,\,b} = 2\,\text{PFL}\left(-\frac{1}{\tan\left(\theta-\alpha\right)}+\sqrt{\frac{1}{\tan^2\left(\theta-\alpha\right)}+1}\right)
\end{equation}

In order to have the OAP0 output beam diameter equal to the DM clear aperture we have~:
\begin{equation}
	x'_{\text{Ex}\theta\,\,u}-x'_{\text{Ex}\theta\,\,b} = \diameter_\text{DM-beam}
\end{equation}
The parental focal length (see appendix~\ref{sec:EFL2PFL}) of OAP0 is :
\begin{equation}
	\text{PFL} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{\diameter_\text{DM-beam}}{-\frac{1}{\tan\left(\theta+\alpha\right)}+\sqrt{\frac{1}{\tan^2\left(\theta+\alpha\right)}+1}+\frac{1}{\tan\left(\theta-\alpha\right)}-\sqrt{\frac{1}{\tan^2\left(\theta-\alpha\right)}+1}}
\end{equation}
Using the equation~\eqref{eq:EFL2PFL} described in appendix~\ref{sec:EFL2PFL} we can transform the parental focal length into the effective focal length.\\

For the OAP0 the angle $\alpha_{\text{OAP0}}$ is
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:alpha_OAP0}
	\alpha_{\text{OAP0}} &= &\arctan\left(\frac{\diameter_{\text{ExP}/2}}{\overline{\text{ExP-FP}}}\right)
\end{eqnarray} 
The numerical application of \eqref{eq:alpha_OAP0} with $\diameter_{\text{ExP}} = 727.4046$ mm and $\overline{\text{ExP-FP}} = 10338.74$ mm gives $\alpha_{\text{OAP0}}  = 2.015\degree$, the aperture demi~angle of the beam arriving on the first OAP.\\

After the discussion we had with Paolo Spano, we took his advice into account and choose the parabola tilt angle according to the following precept : $\theta= 35\degree$ is a critical choice and $\theta > 35\degree$ is a nightmare (manufacturing and alignment). We should take an tilt angle smaller than 30$\degree$ to be realistic and the smaller the best.\\

We set the parabola tilt angle to $\theta = 10\degree$ in order to keep this angle very small. This way we can see that the DM is quite close to the telescope focal plane (about 2~cm). We choose to increase this distance with a view to update the entire design to a GLAO one (and a larger FoV). We finally set the tilt angle of the OAP0 to $\theta = 15\degree$ to keep it as small as possible to limit aberrations.\\

Using these inputs the focal length of the OAP0 is (appendix~\ref{app:DimensionnementOAPs}): $\text{PFL}_{\text{OAP0}} = 456.99\,\text{mm}	\nonumber$.\\
This value is too specific so we round it to\footnote{In Zemax, we enter the $\text{PFL}_{\text{OAP0}}$ and not the effective focal length in the coordinate break surface because using it, the translation is done before the tilt angle. This is why if we enter the translation in a surface before the coordinate break we cannot use the same length (we would then write the $\text{EFL}_{\text{OAP0}}$)}~:
\begin{equation}
	\text{PFL}_{\text{OAP0}} = 455\,\text{mm}	\nonumber
\end{equation}

The image of the exit pupil given by OAP0 gives the position of the DM. Its position $p_i$ relative to the OAP0 vertex is given by (we use Gauss law)~:
\begin{eqnarray}
	p_i &= &\frac{p_o\,\text{PFL}_{\text{OAP0}}}{p_o+\text{PFL}_{\text{OAP0}}}\\
	p_i &= &\frac{-(10338.74+455)455}{-10338.74}\\
	p_i &= &477\,\text{mm}
\end{eqnarray}
The Zemax "pick up pupil position" macro is used to get the perfect DM position wrt the OAP0. The DM is then at $p_i = 491.50$~mm. Even if we understand that we cannot align the DM reflecting surface with this accuracy, we keep it in the Zemax model and we will work on that during the tolerancing analysis\footnote{We always keep all the digits during an AO design in order to see what are the best results we can obtain with an ideal system.}. \\

  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/DM_pupil_tilt.PNG}
  \caption{Tilted image of the pupil}\label{fig:DM_pupil_tilt}
\end{wrapfigure}
The image of the pupil through a tilted OAP is also tilted~(see~\cite{cite:Design90degOAP}). This creates pupil aberrations. Here we want to place the DM at this pupil position. When we work with OAPs the image stop after an OAP is not perpendicular to the optical axis.\\

The OAP introduce a tilt angle of the image plane. If we tilt the DM in the opposite position of this OAP-introduced tilt angle we add pupil aberrations whereas if we tilt it the same direction we can compensate for it.

The beam footprint on the DM shows that all the field fits inside the clear aperture. The maximum diameter is equal to 32.9656 mm ($< 33$ mm \hl{To Paolo : is this okay ? because we are close to the limit... should I take a focal length of 450~mm which gives us a footprint diameter on the DM of 32.603~mm ? maybe it is okay for modelling an ideal case but I should review this value for our real case during the tolerancing analysis..}). The angle of the DM is set to~-7.73\degree~(equation~\eqref{eq:alphaDM}),and not 7.73\degree as explained above (pupil aberration compensation).

\subsection{Imaging the pupil on the TT modulation mirror and focus on the pyramid apex}

\subsubsection{Create an image of the pupil}
We need to image the pupil on the TT modulation mirror. Moreover, we know that to compensate for the aberration introduced by OAP0 we can use an OAP1 with the same focal length. The F/D ratio would stay the same as the telescope one which is favourable for the science path.\\
Figure~\ref{fig:Zemax_model_FP_OAP1} shows that to model this combination we use the "chief ray" solve on Zemax (Lens data) to keep the coordinates following the beam path (using the on-axis ray). OAP1 is placed at the exact inverse position of OAP0 in order to compensate for its aberrations so the intermediate focal plane is near the telescope focal plane.\\

\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/Zemax_model_FP_OAP1.PNG}
		\caption{Zemax model from the telescope beam to the intermediate focal plane}\label{fig:Zemax_model_FP_OAP1}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
We use an optimization (smallest spot radius) to go to the best focal plane (surface \#23 thickness is set as variable) and in order to consider the field curvature we set the radius of the image plane variable. The optimization using a merit function (Type~:~P2V, Criteria~:~Spot~Radius, Reference~:~Chief~Ray) is done on the image surface to get the smallest spot radius of the central beam (FoV = 0'). We can see that the spot diameter varies between 0.345~$\mu$m and 0.009~$\mu$m (the center of the FoV) but when we look the spots with the Airy disk we can say that the beam is well focused.\\
However, the radius of the image curvature is smaller than the telescope output field of curvature so we did not compensate for that, instead we increase it (we will see how we could work on that or not \hl{Paolo : how could I compensate for it ?}).\\

\subsubsection{Bend the beam}
In order to avoid to send back the beam on the focal plane and because we would like to place the dichroic nearby the intermediate focal plane, we fold the beam after the DM with a flat mirror.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/FP_2_intFP_FoldMirror.PNG}
		\caption{Zemax model from the telescope beam to the intermediate focal plane with a fold mirror after the DM}\label{fig:FP_2_intFP_FoldMirror}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:FP_2_intFP_FoldMirror} shows the new design with a folding mirror tilted at 20\degree. For more clarity we apply the real aperture size of the OAPs on layout 2. We can see on the footprint diagram that we can use two OAPs of 30~mm of diameter. Actually, manufacturers can guaranty the surface quality on 90\% of the diameter so the useful optical surface diameter is 27~mm (according to the discussion with Mirsad). The maximum diameter of the beam footprint (for a FoV~=~1') is about 50.25~mm. However, we should be careful and verify during the tolerance analysis that when we move the OAP in the alignment precision range we can do, the entire beam stays reflected on the OAP (no vignetting). Concerning the folding mirror, we can use a diameter of 2~inches (footprint diameter~=~45.72~mm) it is positioned at 286~mm from the DM (same as above, we have to check during the tolerancing that we do not have vignetting when moving around this position).\\

After redoing the optimization of the intermediate focal plane position and the image radius of curvature we found spot diameters vary from 0.009~$\mu$m (on-axis) to 0.436~$\mu$m (0.5') across the FoV (see figure~\ref{fig:IntermediateFP_SpotDiagram}).\\

		\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{images/IntermediateFP_SpotDiagram.PNG}
		\caption{Spot diagram at the intermediate focal plane for the AO FoV and the WFS path FoV}\label{fig:IntermediateFP_SpotDiagram}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Sending the light to science instruments}
We want to introduce a dichroic membrane nearby the intermediate focal plane to reduce its diameter. Then a folding mirror is added to send the light to the instruments. This allows avoiding a large incidence angle on the dichroic which would generate a large reflection loss due to polarisation. The dichroic tilt angle is set to 20\degree and in order to send the beam collinear to the output of the telescope, the folding mirror is put at 7\degree of tilt.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/Zemax_model_FP_Dichroic.PNG}
		\caption{Zemax model from the telescope focal plane to the intermediate science light}\label{fig:Zemax_model_FP_Dichroic}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
The dichroic membrane send the infrared light to the science and let the rest going through the WFS sensor path. The cutting line should be around 900~nm (according to the Nuvu camera QE). The FoV at the WFS path is about 8'' which corresponds (for Zemax) to a demi-FoV of 8/(2*3600)~=~0.001111\degree.\\

We could also replace the folding mirror with an OAP in order to make the beam collimated again to avoid having very large diameter beam arriving at the instrument entrance.
\hl{analyse this possibility !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!}

\subsubsection{Imaging the pupil on the TT modulation mirror and focus on the pyramid apex}\label{subsubsec:TTMM}
Now, as the OAP0 and OAP1 are the same, this optical configuration creates an image of the pupil of the same diameter at the same distance from the FP as the exit pupil.\\ 
It is so not possible to use it to place the TT modulation mirror which has to be 10~mm in diameter and at a reasonable distance from FP.
\hl{FOR these reasons........................................ we take a TT modulation mirror of \diameter 0.5~inch mounted on the fast tip-tilt platform S-331 from PI.}\\

We know that we need to arrive on the pyramid roof (P-WFS) with~:
\begin{eqnarray}
	\text{PSF FWHM} &> 2\text{pyramid roof}\nonumber\\
	\lambda\frac{f}{D} &> 2\text{pyramid roof}\nonumber\\
	\frac{f}{D}&>2\frac{\text{pyramid roof}}{\lambda}\label{eq:FnumEq}
\end{eqnarray}

Taking a pyramid roof of about $20~\mu$m according to Jean-Pierre Veran (private communication) at $\lambda~=~0.6~\mu$m we have~:~~$F\# = 66.7\label{eq:Fnum}$

We round this value to F\#~=~60 (we need to investigate the minimum pyramid roof size that can be manufactured).\\

We want then a power that takes the beam with a F\# of 14 and brings it to 60. The TT modulation mirror is placed in this converging beam at the pupil position. We choose to take an imaging doublet lens because the wavelength range in the WFS path is 500~nm to 900~nm and achromatism can be easily compensated.\\
At first approximation, we can do a geometrical dimensioning. We use a drawing software and apply the constraints to calculate which focal length and distance from the intermediate focal plane we need. In order to build this ray tracing properly we calculate the following parameters~:
\begin{eqnarray}
	F\#_\text{input} = \frac{\overline{\text{ExP-FP}}}{\diameter_{\text{ExtP}}}\nonumber\\
	F\#_\text{output} = \frac{f_\text{lens}}{\diameter_\text{beam on the lens}}\nonumber\\
	\gamma_\text{input} = \frac{1}{2F\#_\text{input}}\nonumber\\
	\gamma_\text{output} = \frac{1}{2F\#_\text{output}}\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
The image of the pupil is nearby the foci (at 0.06~mm) and its raius has to be 5~mm. Taking the angles and the beam diameter on the TT modulation mirror we find the focal length of the lens and the distance from the intermediate focal plane described figure~\ref{fig:SW_trace_rayons_lens_TTMM}.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{images/SW_trace_rayons_lens_TTMM.PNG}
		\caption{Ray tracing using SolidWorks to approximate the converging lens before the TT modulation mirror}\label{fig:SW_trace_rayons_lens_TTMM}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
The focal length is rounded to $f~=~140$~mm. We introduce these results in Zemax using a paraxial lens (figure~\ref{fig:Zemax_model_FP_TTmod_noTilt}). We use the optimization tool to find the best focal plane (distance and radius of curvature at the image plane). We can see that the beam diameter on the TT modulation mirror surface is about 5~mm as expected. Taking a distance from the intermediate focal plane to the lens of 173~mm and the beam footprint diameter on the paraxial lens (on-axis case) we have a F\#$~=~\frac{136.58+597.36}{6.0897*2}~=~60.2$ which is larger than the F\#fixed before at 60.

		\caption{Zemax model from the telescope beam to the TT modulation mirror using a paraxial lens}\label{fig:Zemax_model_FP_TTmod_noTilt}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

In order to correct for the atmospheric chromatic dispersion we need to introduce an ADC (Atmospheric Dispersion Compensator, see~\ref{subsec:ADC}) in our system. This one has to be as close as possible to a pupil plane so to avoid to reimage the pupil and add optical surfaces we choose to insert it arount the TT modulation mirror. For now, we have placed the ADC in the design but it is only made of air. It is just here to have an idea of its size and the room we need for it arount the TT modulation mirror (see figure~\ref{fig:Zemax_model_FP_ApexPyr}).\\

We want to tilt the TT modulation mirror to send the beam in a convenient direction. Moreover we want to add the ADC around it so we can tilt the TT modulation mirror with an angle of about 20\degree. The diameter of the beam footprint on the TT modulation mirror (tilted to 20\degree) measured on the Zemax model is~10.63~mm (figure~\ref{fig:Zemax_model_FP_ApexPyr}) at maximum (which is smaller than 0.5~inch).\\

		\caption{Zemax model from the telescope beam to the apex of the pyramid WFS.}\label{fig:Zemax_model_FP_ApexPyr}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\hl{Actually, we could play with the angle of the TT modulation mirror to place the ADC closer to the pupil plane. This would be investigate according to the ADC design.}



\subsection{Imaging the pupil on the CCD detector}\label{subsec:4eme_partie}
The detector is the Nuvu EMCCD with 128$^2$~pixels and a pixel size of $24~\mu$m. We have to sample the beam with at least 1 pixel per actuator. In order to relax the alignment specifications we can oversample the beam. According to Jean-Pierre Veran advice an oversampling of 1.5 should be enough. The ALPAO DM-468 has 22 actuators pitchs across the clear aperture diameter (so 23 actuators). Then we can calculate the beam diameter on the detector :
\begin{eqnarray}
	\diameter_{\text{CCD}} &= &\#_{\text{actuator across \diameter}}\times \text{PxSize}\times\text{Oversampling factor}\\
	\diameter_{\text{CCD}} &= &22\times 24~\mu\text{m}\times 1.5\\
	\diameter_{\text{CCD}} &= &0.792\,\,\text{mm}
\end{eqnarray}

The pupil has to be imaged on the camera through a relay lens. The pyramid does not act for the ray tracing and so the optical design, it separates the beam in four images only. We can look for the on-axis rays to dimension the relay lens and its position.\\
In order to play with the variables and have a direct result of what could be done or not, we used a sketch on the drawing software SolidWorks (figure~\ref{fig:SW_trace_rayons_TTMM_CCD}). Then, when we find something roughly fine we introduce the values in Zemax and optimize the distances in order to find the proper pupil plane and diameter.
\begin{figure}[H]

		\caption{SolidWorks ray tracing from the TT modulation mirror to the CCD.}\label{fig:SW_trace_rayons_TTMM_CCD}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
We choose to fix the lens focal length in order to have a feasible lens. Playing with this distance we found that a lens of f~=~60~mm would be our best choice. We have changed the distance between the pyramid apex and the lens from 181~mm (according to figure~\ref{fig:SW_trace_rayons_TTMM_CCD}) to 213.615~mm to adjust for the pupil diameter. The distance from the lens to the CCD detector is fixed by the pupil position solver in Zemax. We can see figure~\ref{fig:Zemax_model_FP_CCD} that at the pupil plane, the pupil image has a diameter of $2*0.396~=~0.792$~mm as expected.

The natural guide star selection in the FoV is made using a XYZ stage where the WFS path is mounted. The TT modulation mirror is on a pupil plane so it can modulate the beam around the apex of the pyramid irrespectively of the star position. However, the pyramid has to be placed at the star focus in the FoV. The XY stage allows the NGS selection while the Z axis allows realigning the pupil when needed.

\subsection{The entire design}
Here is the entire design of the AO system.

\subsection{Aberrations}
The AO optical model on Zemax shows that if the alignment and optical surfaces are ideals we should have a total amount of aberration less than 1 nm (largely dominated by spherical aberrations). However, we know that it is not going to be the case and some tolerance analyses are on process to give a realistic approximation of the system aberrations.

\subsection{Atmopsheric Dispersion Compensator (ADC)}\label{subsec:ADC}
We are designing an ADC to compensate the atmospheric dispersion (see appendix\ref{app:ADC}). The geometric parameters and the glass are not set yet this is why we do not have implemented it in the Zemax model for now.

\subsection{Further development and optimization}
The current design will be completed with the optimized ADC, real lens models, the pyramid double prisms and an optional neutral density filter placed nearby the dichroic membrane to protect the camera for the bright stars.\\
This design could be slightly modified in order to update it to a GLAO (Ground Layer Adaptive Optics) system. We could add a beam splitter before the PWFS shoe box and duplicate this PWFS.
