# AO_DESIGN
Here are the codes and simulations for the design of the AO.

The Dimension code shows the calculations made to compute the OAP focal length and distances.

The Zemax file present the current status of the AO design.
The wavelength range is ???
The field of view is 1 arcmin (FoV/2 = 1/2x1/60=0.008333333°) before the dichroic and 8'' ((FoV/2 = 1/2x1/3600=0.00111111°) in the WFS path.
